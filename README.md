# FlanksFolder


## 1. Project description
FlanksFolder is a webapplication at this moment in time designed to store
my projects and some information about my hobbies. FlanksFolder will have 4 pages the first being a landing page directing the user to 3 other pages
my experiences in computing, my projects and my hobbies.

## 3. Technologies and resources used
List technologies (with version numbers), API's, icons, fonts, images, media or data sources, and other resources that were used.
* HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
* NodeJs, mySQL , SQL

## 4. Features and improvements for the future
* Fleshing out the base scructure of the website and the visual layout
* connecting the SQL database fully to be both giving information for the website to use but also so that the admin(me) can post new information without going into the database
* a chatbot integration to be used in the experience page or the projects page (tentative)
* fully transitioning from traditional HTML to React.Js formating 
* potential consideration for account based system for others to use (may create a completely different web app for that)
* full deployment
